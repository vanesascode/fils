# `Fils`

- Fils connects people through microblogging and social networking. It can accommodate up to 10,000 active users monthly, even more if the service Clerk was a paid Pro plan.

- The platform `organizes conversations into threads`, where each thread represents a specific topic or subtopic. This allows participants to have separate discussions within the larger conversation, keeping the main conversation organized and easy to follow.

- It is implemented with Next.js for both frontend and backend. It utilizes MongoDB with Mongoose for scalable data management, Zod for data integrity, Clerk for streamlined authentication, and Shadcn/ui, Tailwind, and CSS to enhance the interface.

- Coded with TypeScript and tested with Jest, it ensures project quality and reliability.

- User experience remains a priority throughout the project.

### ðŸ”¹ [Clerk](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs)

handles tasks like user authentication, password reset, email verification, and more. It also provides an API that allows you to interact with the user data and perform actions like creating new users, updating user profiles, and managing user sessions. `Themes` lets you personalize styles.

ðŸ‘‰ In a free account, you have a limit of 1000 users that can register into your app.

---

### ðŸ”¹ [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

is a library or package that provides a set of UI components and utilities for building user interfaces. I took the form and input components to customize it in Threds. When install, it asks you to init the library in order to use it: `npx shadcn-ui@latest init`. After asking the questions, you will see there is a new file in the tree, called `components.json`. Then it's time to run again: `npx shadcn-ui@latest add form` and you will see the components are installed. You'll see them inside the 'components' folder, in a just created folder called 'ui'. It also installs `react-hook-form`, `@hookform/resolvers` and `zod` as dependencies (@hookform/resolvers connects Zod with React Hook Form).

ðŸ‘‰ Careful, when you install it, it may erase all your css globals file, and reset your tailwind.config.js

---

### ðŸ”¹ [Zod](https://zod.dev/)

(which is installed with Shadcn/ui) is a powerful schema validation library that provides static `type inference` and `validation`. So, it is not limited to validating TypeScript. You can define `schemas` using the Zod API and then use them to validate data/objects both in JavaScript or TypeScript. Also, the build process or bundler will generate the necessary files in a `lib` folder. In this very same folder I created my validations. For example, the schema for the 'user' data.

Video explanation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6BE-U3oy80).

ðŸ‘‰ While Typescript alone can provide some level of validation, it is less comprehensive compared to dedicated schema validation libraries like Zod or `Valibot` (this last one is even lighter than Zod). These libraries offer more advanced features such as custom error messages, nested schemas, and complex validation rules.

---

### ðŸ”¹ [Tailwind-animate](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/tailwindcss-animate)

is a Tailwind plugin for creating beautiful animations. For example, a smooth transition for an appearing toast:

```
   {saveMessage === "Already saved" && (
        <div className="rounded-lg bg-dark-1 px-4 py-2 absolute bottom-[-55px] animate-in fade-in zoom-in duration-600 ">
          <div
            className="text-subtle-regular
              text-light-1 text-center "
          >
            {saveMessage}
          </div>
        </div>
      )}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ [Resend](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-nextjs)

is an email API. It is used to send an email notification to the user when another user has commented one of their fils.

- You create an account and get your RESEND_API_KEY

- You create a component to edit how your email will be (email-template.tsx)

- Then, the docs tell you to create an API, but a server action worked better for me (remember to add the 'text' field or it won't work - It is not seen in the Resend examples):

```
import { EmailTemplate } from "@/components/forms/email-template";
import { Resend } from "resend";

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

export async function postEmail(email: string, firstName: string) {
  console.log(email, firstName);

  try {
    const data = await resend.emails.send({
      from: "Fils <fils@resend.dev>",
      to: email,
      subject: "One your Fils has received a new comment",
      react: EmailTemplate({ firstName: firstName }),
      text: "",
    });
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error: any) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to create thread: ${error.message}`);
  }
}
```

Then you can use it in your component when you like:

```
 await postEmail(email, firstName);
```

## ðŸŒŸ Threaded conversations platform

In this social media app, users can post comments on existing threads. By using the parentId and children properties, it is possible to create a `nested structure of comments`, allowing for threaded conversations. Each comment can have multiple replies, and these replies can have their own replies, creating a tree-like structure of comments.

When I created the 'thread' model, I added an optional 'parentID' and possible 'children' properties that would be created when comments are saved. So, `when the comment is created, it takes the id of the original thread as the parentID`. This way it is easy to render either original threads in the clientâ€™s (the ones that donâ€™t have a parentID) and the comments (the ones that do have a parentID).

Then, in the same 'addCommentToThread' server action, I am `pushing the comment as children to the original thread`. So, while I am creating the comment, I am also updating the original thread with this new property in the database. This way, I can render together all the comments that are related to a particular original thread.

Since this is made recursive, once I create a comment from another comment, This second comment gets the ID of the first comment( which is the ID of the original comment) and sets it as its parentID.

Each thread is rendered in a ThreadCard component, which in the case of comments, has a boolean true 'isComment' prop. This makes it possible to conditionally render or apply different styles or behaviors based on whether the component represents the original thread or a comment.

A comment can be seen as an 'original thread' in the 'individual thread' page, because the Link that the button of replying holds, is going to /thread/${id} , thanks to the 'params'. And when clicking, then the individual thread page renders again, but placing each thread id into the Thread component that it has to go to.

## ðŸŒŸ NextJS:

### ðŸ”¹ Route Groups

In Next.js, [route groups](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups) allow you to organize your routes into logical groups without affecting the URL path structure. By marking a folder as a route group, you can prevent it from being included in the route's URL path. This is useful for organizing routes, creating nested layouts, opting specific segments into a layout, and creating multiple root layouts.

Route groups are useful for:

- Organizing routes into groups e.g. by site section, intent, or team.
- Enabling nested layouts in the same route segment level:
  *- *Creating multiple nested layouts in the same segment, including multiple root layouts
  *- *Adding a layout to a subset of routes in a common segment

To create a route group, wrap the folder's name in parentheses. For example, (marketing) or (shop). This will omit the folder name from the URL path.

So, in this app, there are two route groups, `(auth)` and `(root)`. So, for example, this is not going to happen: http://localhost:3000/auth or http://localhost:3000/root

---

### ðŸ”¹ Server Actions

Server actions are used to handle form submissions, mutations, and other server-side operations in Next.js applications. They provide a convenient way to create server-side endpoints to, for example, handle data mutation through user interacting with forms (as in the case of this app), `without the need to create separate API routes`.

With server actions, you can define server-side functions that are executed when the form is submitted. These functions can access the form data and perform the necessary server-side operations, such as updating the database.

In this project, inside the `lib` folder, you have a folder called `actions`. In it, you have the files with functions that perform server actions. These functions are used to fetch and update user data. for example, in the app.

---

### ðŸ”¹ searchParams and Pagination

In Next.js, the searchParams property is derived from the `query parameters in the URL`. It allows you to access and manipulate these parameters. So, to deal with the pagination, I was able to pass the searchParams object to the fetchPosts server action function in order to retrieve posts based on the page number. This server action function also gives me access to a variable I called `isNext`, which determines if there are more posts to show on the next page.

To enable or disable the pagination buttons, I created a Pagination component. In there, there is a `handleNavigation` function that handles the navigation logic based on the button clicked and updates the URL accordingly.

The initial pagination value is set to 1, of course, and the searchParams object is updated with the new page value when the 'Next' button is clicked. This allows you to navigate through the pages and update the URL accordingly.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Design:

Fils has a design carefully crafted to grab attention and enhance usability. It is actually following the `neobrutalism` style of one of clerk's theme, which, since it is a free version of the software, it is not very much editable.

It is also prepared to be both a `desktop` and a `native mobile` web application. When on the desktop, you are able to see the left and right sidebars, and when on mobile, all the buttons are on the bottom, so it is easier to navigate the app with the thumb of the hand of the user. Totally responsive.
